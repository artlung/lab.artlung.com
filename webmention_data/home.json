An example, for me to get lorem ipsum text for a project, from wherever I\u2019m sitting at work, all I need to do it do a search for artlung greek. Blammo, there\u2019s my lorem ipsum for my project. Any number of items in my lab are just like that. In so doing I appear nearly clairvoyant to my co-workers. But like any good programmer, I am merely lazy. I have no need to memorize lorem ipsum. I have no need to keep a file with lorem ipsum on my desktop at work. But with a string of 13 letters and a click I get precisely what I need. Google is my command line to the web. And I think I am not alone."},"mention-of":"https:\/\/lab.artlung.com\/","wm-property":"mention-of","wm-private":false,"rels":{"canonical":"https:\/\/artlung.com\/blog\/2002\/02\/27\/10213406\/"}},{"type":"entry","author":{"type":"card","name":"Joe Crawford","photo":"https:\/\/webmention.io\/avatar\/cdn.artlung.com\/a0b5bad7e1082e08dc5e72e7f4760d40596782e04895da8b740023e7c1904d15.jpg","url":""},"url":"https:\/\/artlung.com\/blog\/2002\/03\/06\/10475841\/","published":"2002-03-06T18:43:00","wm-received":"2024-12-02T06:09:12Z","wm-id":1864001,"wm-source":"https:\/\/artlung.com\/blog\/2002\/03\/06\/10475841\/","wm-target":"https:\/\/lab.artlung.com\/","wm-protocol":"webmention","name":"New Silly Lab Item.","content":{"html":"<p>In the <a href=\"https:\/\/lab.artlung.com\/\">lab<\/a>:<br \/><a href=\"https:\/\/lab.artlung.com\/scripting\/camel-selector\/\">camelCase &lt;-&gt; selector-case in JavaScript w\/o Regular Expressions<\/a>.
