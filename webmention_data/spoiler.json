      "text": "new gloves kick ass against thorns, if a bit loose (I got large because so many reviews said they run small, I might try a pair of mediums)Win of the week: adapted a post that\u2019s been sitting on draft since last June into my entry for this month\u2019s IndieWeb carnival ????\nLooking forward to: walking with a friend I haven\u2019t seen since summer next week\nStuff I did:\n5.75 hours consulting\n5 hours writing ???????????? wrote several alternate blurbs to help me decide between ending options to feel out what\u2019s more marketable\nmake that late business license a $230 mistake \u2014 the city *also* charged me a late fee of $115 ????\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nset up my new refurbished chair and I don\u2019t like it ???? have initiated a return but need to deconstruct the chair first, and of course the instructions don\u2019t work for the model I got ????\nfinally loaded my library into MusicBee and started doing more cleanup from there \u2014 having a different view makes it more readily apparent which artists I have Too Much of proportional to my liking of them\nalmost two hours of blackberry clearing\u2026 discovered I planted native roses in the gravel zone! I cut one and was like ???? waaiiiiitaminute those thorns don\u2019t look the same\u2026 So now I need to pay closer attention and not just cut anything poky ????\nspent an hour on the phone with five different insurance reps to get them to send me my birth control, my doctor hadn\u2019t prescribed it as continuous use but told me I could take it that way\u2026 wound up needing to request a new prescription in the end ????\nbaked sourdough cream scones flavored with orange zest and dried cherries instead of vanilla (discovered my cranberries were best by 2023 ???? not risking it)\ninvestigated Hardcover as a Goodreads alternative \u2014 it looks awesome but lacks custom statuses, so I have to decide if it\u2019s worth giving up my \u201cnot interested\u201d shelf to switch\u2026 it might be something I wait for them to develop a bit more\nwalked with two friends\n\nDinners:\nIndian kathi roll takeout\nchilaquiles + avocado\nburger takeout: impossible burger with grilled onions and blue cheese\nsausage sandwiches (the hot dog buns were moldy so we had to use hamburger buns ????)\nfruit, cheese and crackers + scone\nThai takeout: stir fried eggplant + coconut fried tofu + rice\nfeta pasta bake again \u2014 used a local sheep feta and maybe overbaked it so it didn\u2019t emulsify this time but still tasted fine \u2014 also used parsley instead of basil\nReading:\nRead Hot Hex Boyfriend by Carly Bloom and Yield Under Great Persuasion by Alexandra Rowland\nDNF\u2019d Annihilation by Jeff Vandermeer (decided it was bad weird not good weird after 40 pages), The Four Dimensional Human by Laurence Scott (I like the metaphor of modem as portal but the writing wasn\u2019t for me), Elements of Taste by Benjamin Everett (the idea of mapping flavors to taste profiles sounds neat but doesn\u2019t bear out), and Salvaging Abby by N.J. Walters (bad guy is pure evil rapist type)\nI was all excited to read Heavenly Tyrant, then I opened it up and (on Kindle) the first *three pages* are content warnings, starting with:\n\u201cPlease beware that this book contains violence and abuse, body horror, mass murder, toxic relationship dynamics, discussions of reproductive coercion, allusions to childhood sexual abuse, and references to miscarriage, domestic violence, sexual assault, and suicide.\u201d\nInstant deflation. In the past year, I have noped out of three books I was excited about after the book opening to gnarly content warnings ????\nWords I looked up \/ concepts I learned:\nTIL chicle is a natural gum, and the name comes from Nahuatl!\nChoice phrases:\n\u201cAt their best, hypertext links are a hint of something, a foreshadowing.
