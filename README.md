*lab.artlung.com*

I originally created the site [lab.artlung.com](https://lab.artlung.com) in 2001 or so because the "Lab" pages on my site at [artlung.com](https://artlung.com) had gotten unwieldy. It's gotten a fair amount of traffic over the years as a resource for code snippets, utilities and experiments.

* 2010
  * Comments were added using [Disqus](https://disqus.com).
* 2016 
  * I created a private repository for the site.
* 2024 
  * I made the repository public as part of [IndieWeb Black Friday Create Day](https://indieweb.org/events/2024-black-friday-create-day).
  * [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) was added
  * Preliminary PHPUnit tests added
