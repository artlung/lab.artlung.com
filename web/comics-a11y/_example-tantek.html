        <p>Picture a comic with four panels, featuring the same scene
            in each. There's a dialog between a woman with a ponytail
            reclining on a couch reading a book, and a man sitting on
            a rolling office chair, working at a desk with keyboard
            and upright flatscreen computer. Sunlight is streaming
            into the room through a closed double-hung window.
            Dialog commences, each line in its own panel, connected
            with a curved segment to the speaker, starting with the
            man and alternating:
        </p>
        <p>“So sunny outside. Let's go for a walk.”</p>
        <p>“It's so sunny, but it's only 18 degrees! [Celsius]”</p>
        <p>“We could hold hands, would that help?”</p>
        <p>“Probably. :)”</p>
