The next panel prompts you to select the BlueDragon installation type. The choices are:
"All Web Sites", "Selected Web Site(s)", "Manual Configuration", and
"Single Virtual Directory".

If you select "Single Virtual Directory", a new Microsoft IIS virtual directory is created
and BlueDragon is installed only in that virtual directory: the BlueDragon assemblies are
placed in the "bin" sub-directory, the web.config file contains the necessary BlueDragon
directives, and script mappings for ".cfm", ".cfml", ".cfc", and ".cfchart" are configured
only for that virtual directory.

If you select any option other than "Single Virtual Directory", BlueDragon is installed
globally: the BlueDragon assemblies are installed into the Global Assembly Cache (GAC)
and the global web.config file is updated to contain the necessary BlueDragon
directives. Script mappings for ".cfm", ".cfml", ".cfc", and ".cfchart" are configured
for All Web Sites or Selected Web Sites based on your choice; if you select
"Manual Configuration", script mappings are not configured for any Web Sites and must
be configured manually.
